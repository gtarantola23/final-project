            <p>
                This website was created to complete the final project of COSC-225: Algorithms and Visualization.
                The authors of this website are Grace Tarantola and Michael Pitts. Our final project visualizes
                different clustering algorithms like k-means, k-means++, and DBSCAN. We provide an overview of
                clustering in the Overview tab.
            </p>
            <p>
                The individual cluster tabs show how each algorithm works. In addition, the comparison tab lets the
                user see exactly how the algorithms compare to one another.
            </p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                We encountered some challenges when creating this project. One example was that there is not a
                random number generator based on the normal distribution in javascript. So, we had to use the Box-Muller
                transformation that scales a randomly generated uniform number into the normal realm. There is also no easy way to 
                pick an element using a weighted distribution so more complex methods had to be applied in the k-means++ scenario. Overall, this was a fun and challenging
                project where we learned a lot of new clustering techniques. We hope you like it!
