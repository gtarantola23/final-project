                In the realm of data analysis, simplification of a problem is crucial in order to extract meaningful
                patterns that can help answer
                pertinent questions. At times, it may be necessary to evaluate the entirety of the data set and
                differentiate unique groups based on
                their distinguishing characteristics. Conversely, in other instances, there may be a need to focus on
                specific groups in order to
                isolate the factors that render them distinctive. Clustering, as a sophisticated analytical technique,
                is instrumental in uncovering
                intricate patterns within complex data. It facilitates the identification of a comprehensive structure
                that offers insights into
                individuals within a dataset and carries significant policy implications. The primary objective of
                clustering is to cluster data units
                in a manner that underscores their "natural association" within the same cluster, while simultaneously
                exhibiting "distinctiveness"
                from other clusters (Anderberg, 1973).

                Categorization, a fundamental and ubiquitous activity among human beings, involves the sorting of
                elements into distinct groups.
                The abundance of events we experience on a daily basis makes it impractical to process the unique
                properties of each individual
                stimulus without the use of categorical frameworks. In the absence of such schemes, every moment of the
                day would demand an equal
                amount of attention and cognitive resources, making it unfeasible to manage.

                Classification is the process of assigning an item into a known category. Once a category is
                established, the essential
                attributes of the group are known and other items can be classified into that group. However, there may
                be some uncertainty with assigning
                any given observation. The complexity of the classification problem can arise due to imperfect
                definitions of classes, overlapping categories,
                and random fluctuations in observations. One way to deal with this is to find the probability the new
                item's membership with each category and
                classify according to some criterion (Anderberg, 1973). The most simple criterion is to classify based
                on the most probable category, but more sophisticated rules
                may be needed if the categories are not equally likely. Cluster analysis refers to discovering a
                category structure that fits the observations.
                Nothing is known about the category structure. The objective is to classify new observations such that
                "natural groups" form.

                It is important to recognize that the process of categorization means that all qualities of the group,
                positive and negative, can
                potentially be assigned to each individual in the group. This can lead to certain feelings being
                associated with each group that may
                or may not be true for every individual. For example, a football player elicits a different emotional
                response than a priest. One must be
                careful of the potential of stereotypes. Every individual in each group is not exactly the same. There
                is a genetic explanation that
                we all possess unique qualities for the sake of diversity and survival of our species. Without our
                indiviudal characteristics, we
                might not be different from a society of robots.

                The analyst of the clustering problem is usually informed about the desirable properties of category
                structures.

                The reason clustering is so difficult is because of the large number of ways that n observations can be
                sorted into m groups. Abramowitz & Stegun (2014)
                show the mathematical formulation of this quantity, which reaches 2,436,684,974,110,751 if we have 25
                observations and 5 groups. This problem gets
                compounded due to the fact that the number of groups is unknown. It would take a long period of time to
                examine all of the possible groups and we would lose
                the ability to make meaningful distinctions between scenarios. Thus, clustering algorithms were created
                to try to solve this problem. <strong>In our final project,
                    we examine three such algorithms, known as k-means, k-means ++, and DBSCAN.</strong> Each of the
                clustering tabs desribes the algorithm used, and shows a visual
                representation of how each algorithm is performed. The comparison tab shows how each algorithm compares
                to one another at each step.

                The visual representation of clustering becomes limited as one goes beyond two dimensions. While,
                some packages allow for a visual of a 3 dimensional clustering result, we cannot visualize the fourth
                dimension
                well. So, there are visual limitations as the clustering is done on multiple categories.
